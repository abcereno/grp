This process involves challenging the reported information with the relevant parties: credit bureau, creditor, and collector. Customized dispute letters will be drafted and submitted to each entity. Due to the nature of this process and the potential for inquiries and responses, the resolution timeline can range from 30 to 45 days.

        description: "Once we receive the updated reports from the credit bureaus, our team will conduct a thorough analysis. This involves verifying if the disputed information - previously identified as inaccurate, unverifiable, or misleading - has been successfully removed or corrected. If the information is still on the report, we go back to the entities that furnished the report and start asking questions about why the information was not removed or updated. If the information on the report has been updated, we will move on to the next identified discrepancy on your credit report, prioritizing further dispute resolution efforts.",
